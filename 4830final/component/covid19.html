          We have always done our best to maintain a safe and healthy environment year-round at Bimmer Haus by providing hand sanitizer and disposable tissues at the front counter and encouraging frequent hand washing for all employees.  And since the day we opened more than 20 years ago we have had our customer waiting area, offices, and restrooms professionally cleaned every week.<br>
          <br>
      On March 12, 2020 we enhanced our standards and procedures for hygiene, hand washing, sanitation, and customer protection in our offices, customer waiting areas, and throughout the workshop.</span></p>
